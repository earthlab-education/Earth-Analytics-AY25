Matt is the Fire Risk & Forest Resilience Project Manager for the Balch Fire Lab. In this role, Matt manages diverse research projects related to wildfire, disturbance, and ecosystem resilience at large spatial scales. Prior to joining the Balch Fire Lab, Matt researched how habitat fragmentation and wildfire altered species distributions across Australian montane forests. He also has experience managing river, forest, and grassland restoration projects and large-scale ecological monitoring programs. He holds a PhD and BA in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from the University of Colorado Boulder.

In his free time, Matt likes to put his restoration ecology experience to practice by pulling weeds and designing native seed mixes to improve the local ecology around his home. He also enjoys trail running, biking, and skiing with his puppy, Puddle.
