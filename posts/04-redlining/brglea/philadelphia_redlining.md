Hopefully that link works, if not feel free to go to my [portfolio](https://brglea.github.io)
It is rather long so I really apologize to whoever ends up having to review it.
This is the only topic the whole class I knew something about so I wanted 
to make it as comprehensive as I could. 

Let me know if there are any errors with images/plots, code stuff, or spelling wise 
and I will fix stuff!
