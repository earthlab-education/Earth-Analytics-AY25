# The Great Mosque-Cathedral of Córdoba, Spain - La Gran Mezquita-Catedral de Córdoba, España

"Dating to the 8th century, the Great Mosque-Cathedral of Córdoba is an example of Umayyad sacred architecture in what is current Spain. While this structure had its formations in the 780’s C.E., it expanded over the next two centuries eventually doubling from its original size. Like other mosques and Islamic architecture from the period of Islamic rule in Spain, the Great Mosque of Cordoba was transformed by later ruling Catholic Spaniards. Despite these transformations, the Great Mosque of Cordoba remains significant to Islamic art and architecture through its decorative tradition and the architectural features that attribute to the sacredness of the building..."
