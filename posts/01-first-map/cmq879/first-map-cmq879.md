## First Map Post

### The University of Illinois Chicago

A large public research university not far outside of Chicago's famed 
Loop, the [University of Illinois at Chicago Circle was established in the 1960s](https://www.uic.edu/about/history/)  
near the interchange of two interstate highways and several different 
neighborhoods<sup>1</sup>. Its east campus, adjacent to downtown Chicago, includes 
a nearly complete list of the colleges one expects to find at an R1 
institution. The west side health campus houses several additional colleges, including the School of Public Health. 

I'm including this interactive map where you can scroll out and identify 
where the campus is relative to parts of the city you might have visited
if you've been to Chicago before.

I chose UIC for this map post because I studied and worked there for 10 
years, completing a B.A. in Sociology and M.S. in Epidemiology and 
working on health behavior-related community environment research at the 
Institute for Health Research and Policy.
